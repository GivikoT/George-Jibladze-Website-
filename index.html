                George Jibladze was born on March 31, 1934 in Tbilisi. He
                mastered the art of Georgian national dance in the choreographic
                ensemble at the Tbilisi Production Cooperative House under the
                leadership of the Honored Artist of the Republic, Mikheil
                Shubashikeli. From 1953 to 1973, he worked as a dancer
                in the State Honored Academic Ensemble of Georgian National
                Dance under the leadership of People's Artists of the Soviet
                Union Nino Ramishvili and Iliko Sukhishvili. He achieved real
                professional perfection in the academic ensemble. Giorgi
                Jibladze was always distinguished by his own performance style.
                An excellent performer of "Mtiuluri" (mountain dance), he showed
                his indomitable temperament brilliantly while performing various
                complex tricks.
